## How to install and run

1) Download and install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) Python distribution, if you don't already have conda installed on your computer.
2) Clone or download [sake-plan](https://github.com/SAKEverse/sake-plan) repository.
3) Run *SAKE Plan.lnk* file in the sake-plan repository. First run will install the app which will take several minutes.

## Considerations

-> Currently only works with Windows OS.

-> Labchart files should contain only one block (otherwise the longest block will be selected)
